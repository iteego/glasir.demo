* This is the settings.gradle file. It is by convention used by
* gradle to set up multi-project project hiearchies.
*
* When executing gradle against a build.gradle file, gradle will
* start by searching down the directory tree to see if it can find
* a settings.gradle file and if so it it should consider itself
* a part of a multi project build. Note that the settings.gradle
* file is executed in the initialization phase of gradle execution
* i.e. before almost anything in the build.gradle itself
*
* We start by referencing the atgradle artifact from the iteego repository
* to get access to the build classes required.
