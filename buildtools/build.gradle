 *
 * The first line below applies the glasir build plugin for ATG projects to this
 * gradle build file. This injects a number of conventional methods and properties
 * into this build file.
 *
 * Applying this plugin also automatically adds project dependencies to 
 * the sub-projects of this project. These dependecies are based on the ATG 
 * module dependencies defined in MANIFEST.MF files in the scm directory 
 * structure for this project. In essence this translates the ATG module 
 * structure into a gradle project structure (viewable via running
 * 'gradle projects' in the 'buildtools' dir). In practice this means that if
 * an ATG module 'A' says:
 *
 * ATG-Required: B
 *
 * in its MANIFEST.MF file and you run "gradle :A:build" to execute the 
 * 'build' task on the project 'A' then gradle will first build the gradle 
 * project for module 'B' as 'B' is marked as required by A. It will then 
 * build project 'A' and include the jar created by B and all the jars
 * B needs in its compile classpath. This is transitive so build chains of
 * arbitrary depth can be created.

This is gradle project for building, testing, and assembling the ${rootProject.name} 
ecommerce project 

Example usages: 
  gradle tasks                - Show common tasks.
  gradle projects             - Show the global project structure.
  gradle test                 - Compile main and test sources, execute unit 
                                tests in all modules, and generate reports.
  gradle build                - Compile main sources.
  gradle :MyBrand:Store:build - Run the build task on a specific atg module 
                                (MyBrand.Store) and all its dependencies.
  gradle printMyBrand.Store   - print a dependency tree for a specific atg 
                                module (MyBrand.Store in this example).
